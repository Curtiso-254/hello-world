# hello-world
This is my first repository in github. I hope i pull through this
I am Curtis Gituanja, an IT student based in Kenya whose been marveled into this world of tech. I was currently introduced to github through NEtworkchuck(youtube) since I cannot rely 100% on the content they give at school(i believe its outdated). My first time venturing into this world of github and i cant wait to see what is in store for me
